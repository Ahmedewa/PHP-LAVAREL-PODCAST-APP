COMMON ISSUSES WITH FIREBSE FIRESTORE EMULATOR:


**2. Common Issues with Firebase Firestore Emulator**

The **Firestore Emulator** is an essential tool for local app development and testing without interacting with production data. However, developers often encounter issues during setup and usage.

---

 **2.1 Common Issues and Solutions**

 **Issue 1: Emulator Not Starting**
- **Cause**: Firebase CLI is not installed or configured correctly.
- **Solution**:
  1. Install Firebase CLI:
     ```bash
     npm install -g firebase-tools
     ```
  2. Start the emulator:
     ```bash
     firebase emulators:start --only firestore
     ```

**Issue 2: Firestore Emulator Not Connecting with App**
- **Cause**: The app is still pointing to the production Firestore.
- **Solution**:
  - Update your app to use the emulator:
    ```js
    const firebase = require('firebase/app');
    require('firebase/firestore');

    firebase.firestore().useEmulator('localhost', 8080);
    ```

**Issue 3: Missing Rules**
- **Cause**: The emulator uses Firestore security rules, and they may be missing or misconfigured.
- **Solution**:
  - Add a `firestore.rules` file to your project:
    ```rules
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if true; // Allow all for local testing
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  - Start the emulator with the rules:
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore
    ```

 **Issue 4: Data Not Persisting**
- **Cause**: Emulator data is not persistent between runs.
- **Solution**:
  - Enable persistent storage:
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore --import=./emulator-data
    ```

 **Issue 5: Network Issues**
- **Cause**: Emulator might conflict with other local services.
- **Solution**:
  - Change the emulator port:
    ```bash
    firebase emulators:start --only firestore --host=localhost --port=9000
    ```

 **3. Development Setup for the Entire App**

Below is a **comprehensive development setup** for the app, considering Firebase, 
Firestore Emulator, and other tools.

---

 **3.1 Backend Setup (Laravel)**

1. **Install Laravel**:
   ```bash
   composer create-project laravel/laravel podcast-app
   ```

2. **Install Key Packages**:
   - JWT Authentication:
     ```bash
     composer require tymon/jwt-auth
     ```
   - Sentry:
     ```bash
     composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
     ```
   - Horizon (for queue monitoring):
     ```bash
     composer require laravel/horizon
     ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Update `.env`:
   ```env
   APP_ENV=local
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

**3.2 Frontend Setup (React + Firebase)**

1. **Install React**:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app podcast-frontend
   ```

2. **Install Firebase**:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in React**:
   ```javascript
   import firebase from 'firebase/app';
   import 'firebase/firestore';

   const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "your_api_key",
       authDomain: "your_auth_domain",
       projectId: "your_project_id",
   };

   firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
   export const db = firebase.firestore();
   ```

4. **Use Firestore Emulator**:
   ```javascript
   if (window.location.hostname === 'localhost') {
       db.useEmulator('localhost', 8080);
   }
   ```

---

#### **3.3 Testing Setup**

1. **Set Up Mobb Shield**:
   - Add `mobb-config.yml` for API testing.

2. **Set Up Firestore Emulator**:
   - Start emulator:
     ```bash
     firebase emulators:start --only firestore
     ```
