** Common Sentry Error Patterns and Solutions**

Sentry is a powerful error-tracking tool that helps identify, triage, and
  resolve issues in our application.
    Here's a list of common error patterns and how to address them:

** Common Error Patterns**

1. **Unhandled Exceptions**
   - **Cause**: Exceptions are thrown but not caught in your application.
   - **Solution**: Always wrap critical code in `try-catch` blocks and log exceptions to Sentry.
     ```php
     try {
         $response = $client->get('https://api.example.com');
     } catch (\Exception $e) {
         Sentry\captureException($e);
     }
     ```

2. **Database Connection Errors**
   - **Cause**: Incorrect database credentials or network connectivity issues.
   - **Solution**:
     - Validate database credentials.
     - Ensure the database server is reachable.
     - Log the error in Sentry for debugging.
     ```php
     Sentry\captureMessage('Database connection failed');
     ```

3. **Memory Leaks**
   - **Cause**: Long-running jobs or scripts consuming excessive memory.
   - **Solution**:
     - Use **Laravel Horizon** to monitor memory usage.
     - Log memory leaks in Sentry and optimize memory-intensive operations.

4. **Authentication Failures**
   - **Cause**: Invalid JWT tokens or expired session cookies.
   - **Solution**:
     - Log invalid token usage in Sentry.
     - Implement token rotation and expiration policies.

**2.2 Best Practices for Sentry Error Monitoring**
1. **Environments**:
   - Separate errors by environment (`development`, `staging`, `production`).
     ```php
     Sentry\init(['environment' => env('APP_ENV')]);
     ```

2. **Breadcrumbs**:
   - Use breadcrumbs to track user actions leading up to an error.
     ```php
     Sentry\addBreadcrumb(new Breadcrumb(Breadcrumb::LEVEL_INFO, Breadcrumb::TYPE_USER, 'User action', 'Clicked on button'));
     ```

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevent excessive error reporting by enabling rate limiting in Sentry.
