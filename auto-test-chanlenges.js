                 AUTO-TESTING-CHALLENGES

**1.4 Testing Challenges**
**Problem**:  
- Inadequate test coverage can lead to bugs going undetected.
- Lack of automated testing slows down development.

**Solutions**:  
1. **Increase Code Coverage**:
   - Write **unit tests** for individual components and **feature tests** for API endpoints.
   - Use PHPUnit to verify coverage:

     ```bash
     vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage/
     ```

2. **Run Tests in CI/CD**:
   - Automate testing in GitHub workflows:

     ```yaml
     - name: Run Tests
       run: vendor/bin/phpunit
     ```

**1.5 Secrets Management Challenges**
**Problem**:  
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets in the codebase can lead to breaches.
- Manual secrets rotation is error-prone and time-consuming.

**Solutions**:  
1. **Dynamic Secrets Retrieval**:
   - Use AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault to fetch secrets dynamically.

2. **Automated Secrets Rotation**:
   - Configure automatic password rotation for database credentials in AWS Secrets Manager.
