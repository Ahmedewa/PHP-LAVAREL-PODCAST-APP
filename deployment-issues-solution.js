              DEPLOYMENT- ISSUES-SOLUTION

**1.3 Deployment Problems**
**Problem**:  
- Deployment inconsistencies between local, staging, and production environments.
- Downtime during deployments.

**Solutions**:  
1. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Use **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and deployments:

     ```yaml
     name: Deploy to Production

     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main

     jobs:
       deploy:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
         - name: Checkout Code
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Install Dependencies
           run: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader

         - name: Run Migrations
           run: php artisan migrate --force

         - name: Restart Server
           run: sudo systemctl restart nginx
     ```

2. **Environment-Specific Configuration**:
   - Use `.env` files for separate environments (development, staging, production).
