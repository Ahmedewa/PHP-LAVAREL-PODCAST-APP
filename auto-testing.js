TESTING BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

 **1.4 Testing**

**Tools**:
- **Mobb**: For automated testing of APIs and UI workflows.
- **Sentry**: For real-time error monitoring and alerting.

**Error Correction Before Deployment**
1. **Testing with Mobb**:
   - Automate end-to-end testing for APIs:
     ```bash
     mobb test run --config=api-tests.yml
     ```

2. **Error Monitoring with Sentry**:
   - Integrate Sentry in Laravel:
     ```bash
     composer require sentry/sentry-laravel
     ```

   - Configure DSN in `.env`:
     ```env
     SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN=https://<your-sentry-dsn>
     ```

   - Capture errors:
     ```php
     Sentry\captureException($exception);
     ```
